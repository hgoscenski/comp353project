# Fruity Co. Database/Website

Fruity Co. computer company needs to be completely redone! The entire company has lost all computer resources and needs to rebuild its website and database systems.
This is a huge endeavor and will require several systems to be working pretty closer together in order to properly implement the major functionalities of their previous system.
We will be implementing the backend database and structure as well as several webinterfaces to interact with the humans who work for Fruity Co. and Fruity Co.'s customers.
